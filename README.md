# GDPR

# GDPR Key Concepts

## Scope of GDPR
### Territorial Scope
- Applies to organizations established in the EU
- Applies to non-EU organizations that:
  - Offer goods/services to EU residents
  - Monitor behavior of EU residents
  - Process EU resident data

### Material Scope
- Applies to processing of personal data
- Applies to automated and manual processing
- Covers both digital and physical records


## Core Principles (Article 5)

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
#### Lawfulness
##### Core Requirements
- Processing must have a **valid legal basis** under Article 6(1)
- Must comply with **all relevant laws**, not just GDPR
- Processing must fall under one of these bases:
  - Consent
  - Contract
  - Legal obligation
  - Vital interests
  - Public interest
  - Legitimate interests
    
##### Detailed Breakdown of Legal Bases

###### 1. Consent
**Requirements**
- Must be **freely given**
- Specific and informed
- Unambiguous indication of wishes
- Clear affirmative action

**Key Characteristics**
- Must be as easy to withdraw as to give
- Cannot be bundled with other terms
- Must be demonstrable
- Cannot be coerced or conditional
- Special rules for children's consent

**Invalid Consent Examples**
- Pre-ticked boxes
- Silence or inactivity
- Bundled consent
- Imbalanced power relationships

###### 2. Contract
**When Applicable**
- Processing necessary for contract execution
- Pre-contractual steps at data subject's request
- Direct and objective necessity

**Examples**
- Delivery address for online purchase
- Payment processing details
- Employee data for payroll

###### 3. Legal Obligation
**Characteristics**
- Must be based on EU or Member State law
- Controller must be subject to legal obligation
- Processing must be necessary to comply

**Common Examples**
- Tax reporting requirements
- Employment law compliance
- Anti-money laundering checks
- Regulatory reporting

###### 4. Vital Interests
**Scope**
- Protection of life-critical interests
- Applies to any individual (not just data subject)
- Generally used in emergencies

**Examples**
- Emergency medical care
- Humanitarian emergencies
- Natural disaster response
- Life-threatening situations

###### 5. Public Interest
**Requirements**
- Based on EU or Member State law
- Must serve genuine public interest
- Processing necessary for task

**Common Applications**
- Public health
- Scientific research
- Statistical purposes
- Government functions

###### 6. Legitimate Interests
**Three-Part Test**
1. Purpose test (identify legitimate interest)
2. Necessity test (is processing necessary?)
3. Balancing test (weigh against individual rights)

**Key Considerations**
- Most flexible legal basis
- Requires documented assessment
- Must be genuine and articulated
- Cannot override fundamental rights

**Common Examples**
- Direct marketing
- Fraud prevention
- Network security
- Intra-group transfers

**Documentation Requirements**
- Record of legitimate interest assessment
- Balancing test documentation
- Regular reviews and updates

##### Key Considerations
- Legal basis must be identified **before** processing begins
- Different activities may require different legal bases
- Must document the legal basis being relied upon

#### Fairness
##### Core Requirements
- Processing must not be deceptive or misleading
- Must consider impact on data subjects
- Should not process data in ways subjects wouldn't reasonably expect

##### Key Elements
- Balance of power between controller and subject
- No hidden processing
- No manipulation or deception
- Consideration of data subject's interests and reasonable expectations

#### Transparency
##### Core Requirements
- Must be clear and open about data processing activities
- Information must be:
  - Easily accessible
  - Easy to understand
  - Written in clear language
  - Free of charge

##### Practical Implementation
- Privacy notices must be:
  - Concise
  - Transparent

- Purposes of processing
- Legal basis being relied upon
- Recipients of personal data
- Data retention periods
- Data subject rights
- Right to withdraw consent

#### Interconnection
These three principles work together:
- Lawfulness provides the legal foundation
- Fairness ensures ethical processing

# Case Study Overview
- A Belgian charity case from 2012-2019 involving a donor named Adele
- Highlights issues with **right to object** and **right to erasure**
- Demonstrates the conflict between marketing legitimate interests and individual rights

## Key GDPR Rights Illustrated
1. **Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR)**
- Individuals can object to processing of their personal data
- Must be clearly and unambiguously stated by organizations
- Objections should be respected immediately without additional investigation

2. **Right to Erasure (Article 17 GDPR)**
- Also known as "right to be forgotten"
- Organizations must delete personal data when requested
- Applies when processing is no longer necessary or consent is withdrawn

## GBA Decision Highlights
- **Ruled against the charity**, imposing a €1,000 fine
- Key findings:
  - Controller's interests did not outweigh individual rights
  - Processing for fundraising wasn't reasonably expected
  - Non-compliance lasted 5+ months after erasure request

## General GDPR Rights Framework
The notes outline eight fundamental rights:
1. **Right to be informed** (Articles 13 & 14)
2. **Right of access** (Article 15)
   - Through Subject Access Requests (SARs)
   - 30-day response timeline
   - Can be extended by 2 months for complex requests

## Implementation Requirements
Organizations must:
1. Review existing systems and processes
2. Train staff on GDPR compliance
3. Update privacy policies and notices

## SAR Process Requirements
- Respond within 30 days
- Verify requestor identity
- Handle third-party requests carefully
- Document all requests
- Can charge fees or refuse excessive requests with justification

# GDPR Individual Rights: Rectification and Erasure

## Right to Rectification
- Enables individuals to request updates to inaccurate/incomplete data
- **Response Timeline**: One month deadline after confirming inaccuracy
- **Request Format**: Can be verbal or written

### Handling Rectification
1. **Refusal Options**:
   - Disagreement over accuracy/completeness
   - Controller satisfied with existing data accuracy
2. **Third Party Notifications**:
   - Must inform third parties of rectifications
   - Document if notification is impossible/disproportionate

### Practical Example
- French digital store implementation:
  - System-wide updates for changed contact details
  - Third-party notification processes

## Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

### Valid Erasure Grounds
1. Data no longer needed
2. Consent withdrawn
3. Subject objects with no overriding processing grounds
4. Unlawful processing
5. Compliance with EU/member state law

### Technical Considerations
- **Backup Management**:
  - Applies to both live systems and backups
  - Ensure backups can't be accidentally restored
  - Implement compliance checks for restoration

### Legal Considerations
- **Retention Requirements**:
  - Some records must be kept (e.g., French accounting: 10 years)
  - May need to decline erasure requests due to legal obligations

### Implementation Example
- French digital store considerations:
  - Multiple data storage locations (ordering, CRM, accounting)
  - Third-party fulfillment partner notifications
  - System-wide erasure protocols
