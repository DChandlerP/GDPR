## Core Principles (Article 5)

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
#### Lawfulness
##### Core Requirements
- Processing must have a **valid legal basis** under Article 6(1)
- Must comply with **all relevant laws**, not just GDPR
- Processing must fall under one of these bases:
  - Consent
  - Contract
  - Legal obligation
  - Vital interests
  - Public interest
  - Legitimate interests
    
##### Detailed Breakdown of Legal Bases

###### 1. Consent
**Requirements**
- Must be **freely given**
- Specific and informed
- Unambiguous indication of wishes
- Clear affirmative action

**Key Characteristics**

- Cannot be bundled with other terms
- Must be demonstrable
- Cannot be coerced or conditional
- Special rules for children's consent

**Invalid Consent Examples**
- Pre-ticked boxes
- Silence or inactivity
- Bundled consent
- Imbalanced power relationships

###### 2. Contract
**When Applicable**
- Processing necessary for contract execution
- Pre-contractual steps at data subject's request
- Direct and objective necessity

**Examples**
- Delivery address for online purchase
- Payment processing details
- Employee data for payroll

###### 3. Legal Obligation
**Characteristics**
- Must be based on EU or Member State law
- Controller must be subject to legal obligation
- Processing must be necessary to comply

**Common Examples**
- Tax reporting requirements
- Employment law compliance
- Anti-money laundering checks
- Regulatory reporting

###### 4. Vital Interests
**Scope**
- Protection of life-critical interests
- Applies to any individual (not just data subject)
- Generally used in emergencies

**Examples**

###### 5. Public Interest
**Requirements**
- Based on EU or Member State law
- Must serve genuine public interest
- Processing necessary for task

**Common Applications**
- Public health
- Scientific research
- Statistical purposes
- Government functions

###### 6. Legitimate Interests
**Three-Part Test**
1. Purpose test (identify legitimate interest)
2. Necessity test (is processing necessary?)
3. Balancing test (weigh against individual rights)

**Key Considerations**
- Most flexible legal basis
- Requires documented assessment
- Must be genuine and articulated
- Cannot override fundamental rights

**Common Examples**
- Direct marketing
- Fraud prevention
- Network security
- Intra-group transfers

**Documentation Requirements**
- Record of legitimate interest assessment
- Balancing test documentation
- Regular reviews and updates

##### Key Considerations
- Legal basis must be identified **before** processing begins
- Different activities may require different legal bases
- Must document the legal basis being relied upon

#### Fairness
##### Core Requirements
- Processing must not be deceptive or misleading
- Must consider impact on data subjects
- Should not process data in ways subjects wouldn't reasonably expect

##### Key Elements
- Balance of power between controller and subject
- No hidden processing
- No manipulation or deception
- Consideration of data subject's interests and reasonable expectations

#### Transparency
##### Core Requirements
- Must be clear and open about data processing activities
- Information must be:
  - Easily accessible
  - Easy to understand
  - Written in clear language
  - Free of charge

##### Practical Implementation
- Privacy notices must be:
  - Concise
  - Transparent

Must inform data subjects about:
- Identity and contact details of controller
- Purposes of processing
- Legal basis being relied upon
- Recipients of personal data
- Data retention periods
- Data subject rights
- Right to withdraw consent
- Right to lodge complaints

#### Interconnection
These three principles work together:
- Lawfulness provides the legal foundation
- Fairness ensures ethical processing
- Transparency enables verification of both

#### Documentation Requirements
Organizations must:
- Document legal bases
- Maintain records of processing activities
- Keep privacy notices updated
- Be able to demonstrate compliance
     

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Specific, explicit purposes
   - No processing beyond stated purposes

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Only collect what's needed
   - No excessive data collection

4. **Accuracy**
   - Keep data accurate and up to date
   - Correct or delete inaccurate data

5. **Storage Limitation**
   - Only keep data as long as necessary
   - Delete or anonymize when no longer needed

6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**
   - Ensure appropriate security
   - Protect against unauthorized processing

7. **Accountability**
   - Must demonstrate compliance
   - Active responsibility

## Key Roles
### Data Protection Authority (DPA)
- Independent national supervisory authority
- Handles complaints
- Issues fines
- Provides guidance
- Examples: ICO (UK), CNIL (France)

### Controllers and Processors
- **Controllers**: Determine purposes and means of processing
- **Processors**: Process data on behalf of controllers
- Clear distinction in responsibilities and obligations
